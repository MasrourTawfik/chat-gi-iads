Applications of LLMs
===================


NLP Tasks Overview
------------------

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at reaching human-computer interaction through the natural language. Its goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a meaningful manner.

Practical uses of NLP encompass speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction.

Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant advancement in NLP, leverage increased computing capabilities, abundant data, and machine learning innovations. By digesting vast text corpora, these models discern language patterns, grammatical rules, world knowledge, and reasoning capabilities.

Sentiment Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sentiment analysis not only assesses the general sentiment polarity of text (positive, negative, neutral) but also goes into detecting specific emotions (e.g., joy, frustration, anger, sorrow), levels of urgency (urgent, non-urgent), and intentions (interested vs. uninterested)
