Applications of LLMs
===================


NLP Tasks Overview
------------------

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at reaching human-computer interaction through the natural language. Its goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a meaningful manner.

Practical uses of NLP encompass speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction.

Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant advancement in NLP, leverage increased computing capabilities, abundant data, and machine learning innovations. By digesting vast text corpora, these models discern language patterns, grammatical rules, world knowledge, and reasoning capabilities.

Sentiment Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sentiment analysis not only assesses the general sentiment polarity of text (positive, negative, neutral) but also goes into detecting specific emotions (e.g., joy, frustration, anger, sorrow), levels of urgency (urgent, non-urgent), and intentions (interested vs. uninterested)

Graded Sentiment Analysis (Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For businesses where understanding the precise level of sentiment is necessary, expanding the range of sentiment categories to capture various degrees of positivity or negativity can be beneficial:
- Very positive
- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative
- Very negative

Emotion Detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This approach extends beyond simple polarity to identify specific emotions, such as happiness, frustration, anger, or sadness.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This analysis focuses on identifying sentiments related to specific aspects or features mentioned in texts, determining whether the sentiments are positive, neutral, or negative.
For instance, in the review, "The battery life of this laptop is too short", aspect-based analysis would pinpoint the negative sentiment directed towards the laptop's battery life.

Example:Sentiment Analysis with Python and NLTK
Objective:To determine the sentiment of a given text (positive, negative, or neutral) using the NLTK library.
