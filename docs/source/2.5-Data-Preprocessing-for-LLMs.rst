Data preprocessing for LLMs
==================================

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in our pipeline since a bad data preprocessing leads to bad results.It involves a series of steps to prepare the raw text data for training. 
Effective preprocessing contributes to smoother training, faster convergence, and improved model performance. The goal is to standardize the input data to reduce the complexity that the model needs to handle.
Data preprocessing for large language model involves prominent techniques to pre-process its data .

Data cleaning
------------------------
Data cleaning is a fundamental aspect of data pre-processing for training LLMs. This technique involves identifying and rectifying inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and irrelevant elements within the raw text data. 

Data cleaning methods

1.Handling missing values
----------------------------
Missing values can occur when there is no data for some observations or features in a dataset. These gaps in data can lead to inaccurate predictions or a biased model.
