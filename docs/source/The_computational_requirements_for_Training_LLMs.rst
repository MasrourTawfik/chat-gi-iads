1 The computational requirements for Training LLMs
===============================================
1.1 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
-----------------------------------
GPUs are a cornerstone of LLM training due to their ability to accelerate parallel computations.
Modern deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, leverage GPUs to perform matrix
multiplications and other operations required for neural network training. When selecting a GPU,
factors like memory capacity (VRAM), memory bandwidth, and processing power (measured in CUDA
cores) are crucial. High-end GPUs like NVIDIA’s Tesla series or the GeForce RTX series are commonly
favored for LLM training. The more powerful the GPU, the faster the training process, as an example
The L40S, offers excellent performance and efficiency at an affordable cost. Remember, as technology
evolves, newer and more powerful hardware will continue to emerge, so it is important to stay informed
and reassess your requirements periodically.

1.2 Central Processing Unit (CPU)
----------------------------------
While GPUs handle the bulk of neural network computations, CPUs still play a vital role in data
preprocessing, model setup, and coordination. A powerful multi-core CPU can significantly speed up
data loading, preprocessing, and model configuration tasks. However, for the actual training phase,
the GPU’s parallel processing capabilities take center stage.The two recommended CPU platforms are
Intel Xeon W and AMD Threadripper Pro.

1.3 random access memory(RAM)
------------------------------
RAM is essential for efficiently handling large datasets and model parameters. During training, the
model’s architecture, gradients, and intermediate values are stored in memory. Therefore, a sufficient
amount of RAM is crucial to prevent memory-related bottlenecks. LLM training setups often require
tens or even hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. DDR4 or DDR5 RAM with high bandwidth and capacity
is recommended for handling substantial memory demands.

1.4 Storage
-----------
Storage plays a crucial role in managing the vast amount of data involved in LLM training. Highcapacity, fast storage is required for storing raw text data, preprocessed data, and model checkpoints.
Solid State Drives (SSDs) are preferred over Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) due to their faster read and
write speeds. NVMe SSDs, in particular, offer exceptional performance and are well-suited for LLM
training workflows.

1.5 Networking
--------------
Fast and stable internet connectivity is important for downloading datasets, sharing models, and
collaborating with colleagues. A reliable network connection ensures efficient data transfer and communication between distributed systems if you’re using a cluster setup.

1.6 Distributed Computing
--------------------------
For training very large LLMs, a single GPU might not suffice. Distributed computing setups, where
multiple GPUs or even multiple machines collaborate on training, become essential. This requires
networking infrastructure, software frameworks (e.g., Horovod), and synchronization techniques to
ensure efficient parallel processing. An example of a recommended systeme configuration :
