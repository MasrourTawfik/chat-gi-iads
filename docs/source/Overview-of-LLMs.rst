Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence algorithms that use deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based neural networks, to process and generate natural language. They played a significant role in bringing generative AI to the forefront of the public interest and business applications. LLMs are pre-trained on vast datasets, including text, images, videos, speech, and structured data, enabling them to understand, summarize, and predict new content with high accuracy. The performance of an LLM improves with the number of parameters it uses, which also requires significant computational, data, and engineering resources. The main aim of LLMs is to grasp the complexity of human language, making them invaluable for natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks across various use cases and industries.


Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, improving performance in specialized areas. However, they face challenges such as ethical concerns and biases in training data, as well as the environmental impact of their computational requirements.Overcoming these obstacles is important for their responsible development and deployment.
